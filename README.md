# Simple TV Functionality
This program defines a class named TV that simulates the basic functionality of a TV set, such as turning on and off, changing channels, and adjusting volume. It also defines a function named TestTV that creates two TV objects and tests their methods. The output of the function includes an ASCII art representation of the TV screen, along with the current channel and volume level.

## ðŸ“„ Documentation 
<details><summary><h3> ðŸ’¡ Purpose </h3></summary>

-----

The objective of this program is to demonstrate the basic concepts of object-oriented programming in Python. Using the TV class to encapsulate the TV's state and behavior, we can create multiple TV objects and control their state independently.
</details>

<details><summary><h3> ðŸ¤” Usage </h3></summary>

-----

1. To use this program, simply run the TestTV() function in a Python environment. This will create two TV objects, set their state (channel and volume), and display their state as ASCII art in the terminal.
